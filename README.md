# MathAI
*An AI program that is able to solve any basic and complex math equations and problems entered into the AI*

**How it works:**

+ <ins>User enters multiple problems (ends input with done)</ins>

+ <ins>Each problem gets classified and routed to the proper solver inside a thread pool</ins>

+ <ins>Results are collected and printed once computations finish</ins>

**Use efficient math libraries like:**

+ *Apache Commons Math — reliable, covers statistics, linear algebra, and optimization.*

+ *Symja — symbolic math engine for Java (supports algebraic simplification, calculus, equation solving).*

+ *Uses memoization/caching for repeated calculations (e.g. factorial, combinations, primes).*


*"It also has a Graph you can use to plot points still a work in prograss though"*

**How it works:**

**Insert an example like this into the terminal:**

<ins>GraphPlotter.plotFunction("sin(x)", -10, 10);</ins>

<ins>GraphPlotter.plotFunction("x^2+3*x-4", -10, 10);</ins>
