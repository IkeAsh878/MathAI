# MathAI
*An AI program that is able to solve any basic and complex math equations and problems entered into the AI*

**How it works:**

+ <ins>User enters multiple problems (ends input with done)</ins>

+ <ins>Each problem gets classified and routed to the proper solver inside a thread pool</ins>

+ <ins>Results are collected and printed once computations finish</ins>

**Use efficient math libraries like:**

+ *Apache Commons Math — reliable, covers statistics, linear algebra, and optimization.*

+ *Symja — symbolic math engine for Java (supports algebraic simplification, calculus, equation solving).*

+ *Uses memoization/caching for repeated calculations (e.g. factorial, combinations, primes).*
